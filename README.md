I was able to do a Simple Linear Regression Project on the effect of cost on football scores in England.

Discoveries ~ 

I found from the correlation of the dataset that cost has the highest correlation with scores and with that I began the simple linear regression model prediction.

I was able to add the regression line by deriving b0 and b1 to get the 
y = b0 + b1 * x line

Then I forced the intercept term with statsmodel.OLS

The co-efficient of cost was 0.1821 which means any increase in 1 pound for cost will increase football score points by 0.18.

This later increased to 0.23 after I ran some data cleaning with the statistical tools below.

I used statistical concepts like
1. NON-LINEARITY
2. Heteroskedasticity
3. DEVIATIONS FROM NORMALITY
4. ERRORS NOT IID
5. OUTLIERS
6. ANOVA
7. MISSING PREDICTORS
8. Interpolation and Extrapolation.
